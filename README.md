# Instalight

Example code demonstrating an analytical framework for real-time simulation of photonic integrated circuits(PIC). Parameter tuning through toggle switch is enabled to assist design. In comparison to simulation software such as Lumerical Interconnect, the code largely reduced computational overhead and allows more custom definition of components. 

## Authors

The code is developed by Junhe Zhang (jz3599@columbia.edu).
